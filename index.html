        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
            Hello! My name is Tatiana and I am an aspiring full-stack developer. Currently, I am a Junior at Michigan State University 
            pursuing a dual degree in Computer Science and Information Science through the Honors College. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond my classes, I am very passionate about outreach and increasing the diversity within the profession. Starting my 
            first year at MSU, I have been involved in the MSU Coding Clubs, which teach programming to children in grades 6-12. 
            Since beginning, I have been involved in most aspects of creating these clubs: planning, teaching, mentoring, and more. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, I have been a part of the Women In Computing club since my start at MSU. Through this club, I have been 
            able to make several lasting connections, as well as having the opportunity to attend the Grace Hopper Conference in 
            September 2022. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of college, I have had one software engineering internship over Summer 2022, where I learned a lot about what 
            a professional software engineering role may look like. I was taught how to use JIRA and Crucible in order to use it 
            on a daily basis throughout the internship. Additionally, I learned more about Java and MongoDB, both of which were 
            languages used in my project.
